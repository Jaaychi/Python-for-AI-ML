# will tell you the type of the variable
type("1")
type(1)
type(1.1)

# you can also cast the variable into a different type
float(1)
# will turn this into 1.0
int(1.1)
# will turn this into 1

# you can turn a number into a string

str(1) # will return a string "1"

# type(True) will return bool

# casting a int(True) will return 1 and int(False) will return 0
